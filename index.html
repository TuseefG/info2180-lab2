               My name is Tuseef Graham I am 21 years old . I enjoy video games and midday naps alot .I am in my third year of university majoring in computer science. 
               Many have asked why I had chosen computer science to be my major . The main reason being I don’t really enjoy computer science but I enjoy a challenge more than i might dislike the courses. 
               I hope to finish this degree in timely fashion and make my family as proud of me as possible.

            While being a computer science major I am very involved in sports being a national representative for Jamaica in field hockey. 
            I can proudly say this is one of my greatest achievements to date. To top it off on my most recent competition with the national team being the CAC games I recorded my first international goal vs El Salvador. I think it was the happiest moment of my international career to date. 
I would recommend trying to represent your country to any person I know the pride and adrenaline rush experienced is second to none !
